[Intro]
Eb Cm G# Fm

[Verse 1]
Eb
I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ
                                               G#
This steadfast shall not break apart within the trial
I am assured His promises will never fail
Fm
As long as life remains He is faithful

[Chorus]
Eb              Bb
God is patient, God is kind
G#               Fm
He does not envy, He does not boast
Eb                          Bb
His ways are higher than my own
                        Eb      G#
His thoughts consume the great unknown
                           Bb     Eb
Of this alone I am sure, my God is love

[Verse 2]
Eb
I draw my breath under His created windswept sky
                                                G#
I know my hope shall last long after my flesh retires
                                                 Fm
From dusk until the dawn He calls His children home

His righteous love outlasts generations

[Chorus]
Eb              Bb
God is patient, God is kind
G#               Fm
He does not envy, He does not boast

His ways are higher than my own
                        Eb      G#
His thoughts consume the great unknown
                           Bb       Eb  G#   Eb Bb
Of this alone I am sure, my God is love
