Meant to Live
Switchfoot

Intro:    Bm   A   Em7   G  A

Verse 1:
G                                                                  D
Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by
G                                                                      D
Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly

Chorus:
G                 A                Bm
We were meant to live for so much more
         Em7
Have we lost ourselves?
G                    Em7   G                  Em7
Somewhere we live inside, somewhere we live inside
G                 A                Bm
We were meant to live for so much more
         Em7
Have we lost ourselves?
G                   Em7   D
Somewhere we live inside

Verse 2:
Dreaming about providence, and whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent and broken

Bridge:
         D                             G
We want more than this world's got to offer
         D                             G
We want more than this world's got to offer
         D                         G
We want more than the wars of our fathers
                  C                       G
And everything inside screams for second life

Coda:
D
We were meant to live for so much more.  Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more.  Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more.  Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live, we were meant to live

Outro:  Bm   A   Em7
