Better Is One Day
By Matt Redman

Verse 1:
E                                 A2           Bsus
How lovely is Your dwelling place,   Oh Lord Almighty
   E                              Bsus
My soul longs and even faints for You
   E                            A2            Bsus
For here my heart is satisfied,   within Your presence
    E                              Bsus
I  sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

Verse 2:
          A2
Better is one day in Your courts
          Bsus
Better is one day in Your house
          A2
Better is one day in Your courts
               Bsus
Than thousands elsewhere

Verse 2:
     E                            A2                    Bsus
One thing I ask, and I would seek,   to see Your beauty,
   E                                Bsus
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

    My heart and flesh cry out      to You the living God
C#m7                    Bsus   A2    Bsus
    Your Spirit's water to my soul
C#m7                     Bsus    A2            Bsus
    I've tasted and I've seen,       come once again to me.

    I will draw near to You. I will draw near to You

    To You
