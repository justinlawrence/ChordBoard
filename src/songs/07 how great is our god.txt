How Great Is Our God
Chris Tomlin, Ed Cash, Jesse Reeves

Verse 1:
    B                     G#m7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                  E2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
   B                           G#m7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     E2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


Chorus:
    B                     F#/A#
How great is our God, sing with me,
    G#m7                       F#/A#
How great is our God, all will see,
    E          F#           B
How great, how great is our God.


Verse 2:
 B                        G#m7
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                    E2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
    B                      G#m7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                 E2
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb

Bridge:
B              F#/A#
Name above all names,
G#m7             F#/A#
Worthy of all praise,
E
My heart will sing
F#                B
How great is our God.
