Verse 1:
F#m        D             A
Water You turned into wine
F#m         D              A
Opened the eyes of the blind
               Bm
There's no one like You
          E
None like You

Verse 2:
F#m       D               A
Into the darkness You shine
F#m         D          A
Out of the ashes we rise
                Bm
There's no one like You
          E
None like You


Chorus:
F#m
Our God is greater
D
Our God is stronger
A                       E/G#
God You are higher than any other
F#m
Our God is healer
D
Awesome in power
     A        E
Our God, Our God


Bridge:
F#m
And if our God is for us
D
Then who could ever stop us
A
And if our God is with us
E
Then what could stand against
 E                            F#m D A E
(What could stand against)
