Escape
by Jesse Kongos

Verse 1:
D
Every few thousand years
Bm                       A
Come true man's greatest fears
Bm
All the living things
D
Mother nature brings - to tears

D
When the bombs are bursting in the air
Bm                                  A
And the rockets are making that red glare
Bm
I'm heading down
D
Down to that good hope town - where the weather's fair

Bm   G   D   A

Chorus:
Bm     A         Bm     D
So why don't you come away
G          A
With me my love
     Bm
We'll do what it takes
D
I'll keep you safe

Bm   A        Bm      D
Why don't you stay by me
G                 A
And when the time comes
Bm
We'll escape

Verse 2:
D
When the big one finally hit's LA
Bm                       A
When Yellowstone has it's day
Bm
We're heading to the southern tip
D
On a plane or on a ship
We'll do what it takes - we'll find a way

Verse 3:
D
And if that cloud forms up above
Bm                    A
No sign anywhere of a dove
Bm
There'll be no reason left to stay
D
We'll try and live another day
In a place where there's still love


Bm     A         Bm     D
So why don't you come away
G          A
With me my love
     Bm
We'll do what it takes
D
I'll keep you safe

Bm   A        Bm      D
Why don't you stay by me
G                 A
And when the time comes
Bm
We'll escape
